#MSFS
- Hot patch for HPG H145/H160 implementation which greatly improves the hands on detection
 - There is a new `hands_off_deadzone` setting that will dictate when TelemFFB will notify the helicopter that spring override is no longer active
 - previously the hands on/hands off point was a single deadzone around the center of the stick
 - now a smaller "hands off deadzone" will prevent flapping of hands on detection as the stick will need to be much closer to center to trigger "hands off" than it did to trigger "hands on"

#MSFS
- New special integration with the Hype Performance Group Airbus H145 and H160 Helicopters
 - Full FFB integration with the AFCS for both the Cyclic and Collective axes (Tail rotor axis is planned)
 - Tight integration with the AFCS data provides a true-to-life experience with the Rhino
 - This was a 2-sided project with support from HPG to add necessary capabilities for TelemFFB to communicate the state of the axes for proper implementation!
 - Requires a minimum of Build 43 Patch 2 for the H160 and Build420 Patch 3 for the H145.  These patches are available in the HPG Discord.
- For a full breakdown of the capabilities and tips on setup, check out the VPforce user guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YL5DLkiTxlaNx_zKHEYSs25PjmGtQ6_WZDk58_SGt8Y/edit#heading=h.f30c77lc61iq
- NOTE:  If you are running from python source instead of the exe release file, we have switched to a forked version of pysimconenct to support reading/writing of L:VARS in MSFS.  As such, you will need to `pip uninstall pysimconnect` and then re-run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

** Please read the full documentation in the VPForce Manual **
** https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YL5DLkiTxlaNx_zKHEYSs25PjmGtQ6_WZDk58_SGt8Y **

- New option to send joystick/pedal axis position to MSFS via simconnect.  Requires un-binding axes from MSFS
 - telemffb_controls_axes           - Master control for simconnect axis sending (true/false)
   - joystick_x_axis_scale          - Scale joystick x axis output (0-%100)
   - joystick_y_axis_scale          - Scale joystick y axis output (0-%100)
   - rudder_x_axis_scale            - Scale pedal axis output (0-%100)

- New trim and AP following functionality for fixed wing aircraft.  REQUIRES `telemffb_controls_axes = True`
 - trim_following = True                            - Master control for trim/ap following (true/false)
   - ap_following                                   - Enable/disable ap following (only disables aileron/rudder) (true/false)
   - invert_ap_x_axis                               - Invert the x axis AP follow behavior (req'd for some AC like the default C172)
   - joystick_trim_follow_gain_physical_x           - Physical stick x axis movement as a percentage of the trim value (0-100%)
   - joystick_trim_follow_gain_physical_y           - Physical stick y axis movement as a percentage of the trim value (0-100%)
   - joystick_trim_follow_gain_virtual_x            - Virtual stick x axis movement as a percentage of the physical stick movement (0-100%)
   - joystick_trim_follow_gain_virtual_y            - Virtual stick y axis movement as a percentage of the physical stick movement (0-100%)
   - rudder_trim_follow_gain_physical_x             - Physical pedal x axis movement as a percentage of the trim value (0-100%)
   - rudder_trim_follow_gain_virtual_x              - Virtual pedal x axis movement as a percentage of the physical pedal movement (0-100%)

#General
- Added release notes for tracking updates
- Added link in UI to release notes file

#DCS
- Added intensity and scaling variables for the 'wind' effect
    -wind_effect_scaling    - adjusts the overall strength of the effect
    -wind_effect_max_intensity    - sets an upper threshold vor the wind effect

#MSFS
- Auto detect Helicopter and Jet aircraft based on simconnect variable 'CATEGORY' to avoid executing
    effects that are incompatible with certain aircraft types if the module does not have a definition
    in the config file

- Added glider 'force trim' function which will allow a button binding to relieve and re-center the joystick elevator spring force, similar
    to many modern gliders

    -force_trim_enabled             - enable/disable the effect
    -elevator_force_trim            - enable/disable on the elevator axis
    -aileron_force_trim             - enable/disable on the aileron axis
    -force_trim_button              - Button number to treat as force trim button
    -force_trim_reset_button        - Button number to treat as trim reset button
