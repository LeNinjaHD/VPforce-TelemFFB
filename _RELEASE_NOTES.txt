# MSFS
** Please read the full documentation in the VPForce Manual **
** https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YL5DLkiTxlaNx_zKHEYSs25PjmGtQ6_WZDk58_SGt8Y **

- New option to send joystick/pedal axis position to MSFS via simconnect.  Requires un-binding axes from MSFS
 - telemffb_controls_axes           - Master control for simconnect axis sending (true/false)
   - joystick_x_axis_scale          - Scale joystick x axis output (0-%100)
   - joystick_y_axis_scale          - Scale joystick y axis output (0-%100)
   - rudder_x_axis_scale            - Scale pedal axis output (0-%100)

- New trim and AP following functionality for fixed wing aircraft.  REQUIRES `telemffb_controls_axes = True`
 - trim_following = True                            - Master control for trim/ap following (true/false)
   - ap_following                                   - Enable/disable ap following (only disables aileron/rudder) (true/false)
   - invert_ap_x_axis                               - Invert the x axis AP follow behavior (req'd for some AC like the default C172)
   - joystick_trim_follow_gain_physical_x           - Physical stick x axis movement as a percentage of the trim value (0-100%)
   - joystick_trim_follow_gain_physical_y           - Physical stick y axis movement as a percentage of the trim value (0-100%)
   - joystick_trim_follow_gain_virtual_x            - Virtual stick x axis movement as a percentage of the physical stick movement (0-100%)
   - joystick_trim_follow_gain_virtual_y            - Virtual stick y axis movement as a percentage of the physical stick movement (0-100%)
   - rudder_trim_follow_gain_physical_x             - Physical pedal x axis movement as a percentage of the trim value (0-100%)
   - rudder_trim_follow_gain_virtual_x              - Virtual pedal x axis movement as a percentage of the physical pedal movement (0-100%)

#General
- Added release notes for tracking updates
- Added link in UI to release notes file

#DCS
- Added intensity and scaling variables for the 'wind' effect
    -wind_effect_scaling    - adjusts the overall strength of the effect
    -wind_effect_max_intensity    - sets an upper threshold vor the wind effect

#MSFS
- Auto detect Helicopter and Jet aircraft based on simconnect variable 'CATEGORY' to avoid executing
    effects that are incompatible with certain aircraft types if the module does not have a definition
    in the config file

- Added glider 'force trim' function which will allow a button binding to relieve and re-center the joystick elevator spring force, similar
    to many modern gliders

    -force_trim_enabled             - enable/disable the effect
    -elevator_force_trim            - enable/disable on the elevator axis
    -aileron_force_trim             - enable/disable on the aileron axis
    -force_trim_button              - Button number to treat as force trim button
    -force_trim_reset_button        - Button number to treat as trim reset button
